## a. Custom layout setup

1. Press **Win+Shift+'** to open the zones editor.
2. Click the **Create new layout** button at the bottom-right.
3. Choose your preferred zone layout: **Grid** or **Canvas**:

    In the **Grid** model, you start with a three column grid that you can adapt to suit your needs:

   - To divide a zone, click your mouse.
   - To rotate the divider, hold down the **Shift** key.
   - To move a divider, click on the thumb and drag.
   - To merge zones, hold the left mouse button and drag the mouse until multiple zones are selected. Release the button. A popup menu will show up. Click **Merge**.

    In the **Canvas** model, you start with a blank layout and you can add zones that can be dragged and resized. You can use keyboard for zone editing:
    
      - The **arrows** (up, down, left, right) - to move a zone by 10 pixels
      - **Ctrl+arrow** - to move a zone by 1 pixel
      - **Shift+arrow** - to resize a zone by 10 pixels (5 per edge)
      - **Ctrl+Shift+arrow** - to resize a zone by 2 pixels (1 per edge)
      - **Ctrl+Tab** - to switch between the editor and dialog.
